What is Amazon ECS?
Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. It takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including the provisioning and scaling of resources, allowing you to focus on your applications. ECS is designed to work seamlessly with other AWS services, providing a comprehensive container management solution.

Architecture of Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) architecture comprises several key components that work together to facilitate the deployment and management of containerized applications. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

ECS Clusters:
Logical groupings of EC2 instances, AWS Fargate containers, and other resources where containerized applications are deployed.
Container Instances:
EC2 instances or AWS Fargate containers within a cluster that host containers and are registered with ECS.
Task Definitions:
Blueprints specifying parameters for containers, including Docker image, CPU, memory, and network settings.
Tasks:
Instantiation of a task definition, representing the execution of containers on a container instance within the ECS cluster.
Services:
Manage continuous running and scaling of tasks, ensuring desired task count, and handling lifecycle management.
Scheduler:
ECS component responsible for placing tasks on EC2 instances or AWS Fargate containers, considering resource requirements and availability.
Amazon ECS Agent:
Runs on each EC2 instance, facilitating communication with ECS, receiving tasks, and managing container lifecycle.
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple containers within an ECS service for high availability and efficiency.
Amazon CloudWatch:
Integrated for monitoring, logging, and tracking metrics to provide insights into ECS task and container performance.
Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):
Fully-managed Docker container registry integrated with ECS for secure storage, management, and deployment of container images.
Container Image:
A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. Managed and stored in registries like Amazon ECR.
Elastic Network Interface (ENI):
Virtual network interface that allows containers to communicate with the network and other resources in the ECS cluster.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where ECS clusters and other AWS resources operate, providing control over the network environment.
AWS Fargate:
A serverless compute engine for containers that abstracts away infrastructure management, allowing for simplified deployment and operation of containers.
EC2 Instances:
Virtual servers in the cloud, forming the foundation of ECS clusters. They host containers when using the EC2 launch type.
